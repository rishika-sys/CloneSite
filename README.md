# CloneSite
Here I have create a clone website from gfg using html and css.

I used css attributes to get those designs and alignment. Also used various positioning properties to achieve this.
Used forms ,maps ,buttons ,display and all other interesting properties of html to make this work.

2 css files
1)For index.html
2)For all other webpages.

5 html files.
I have also attached all the images here.


Any suggestions are highly appreciated.
